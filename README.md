# Reported Number of Juvenile Arrests by Crime

The “Reported Number of Juvenile Arrests by Crime” dataset contains a record of monthly juvenile arrests for various offenses from the years 1995 to 2016, categorized by offense, age, gender, or race. Agencies that have reported the arrests are also included in the annual counts that are included within the database. To be considered a juvenile, according to the UCR Program, one must be an individual under the age of 18. The dataset does not include data on individuals who have been contacted by the police for non-offending juvenile or protection custody cases.

The question we want to address with our dataset is whether there is any correlation between the optimal resulting cluster assignments and the categorization of offenses. In the case of our dataset, we will be focusing on unsupervised learning as our study will center around variables that pertain to race, age, or gender. We will analyze the data using clustering algorithms to identify patterns of behaviors and trends over time. Our goal is to provide insights on an effective way to address juvenile delinquency.

# Methodology
Clustering is one of the most common exploratory data analysis techniques used to get an intuition about the structure of the data. In this project, we will focus on clustering assignments using K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. Both models are effective for unsupervised learning and assist in analyzing the patterns as well as the relationships between variables.
